This handbook describes the organisation of Initiativet, our purpose and principles, our central ideas, how we run the party together, how we make decisions and a lot more. The handbook represents the single source of truth, the central repository for agreements, guides, policies, tips and a few rules.

The content in this handbook is in English. Isn't that odd for a Swedish party? Not that odd, really. In a world where traditional party politics and and nation borders become less relevant by the day, the opposite would have been really weird, effectively excluding the 7.19 billion non Swedish speakers of the world.

So, Initiativet is a **decentralised network of individuals forming a co-created political party** - how does that work anyway? This handbook aims to explain just that.

## More handbooks

When building the organism that constitutes Initiativet we seek inspiration from other purpose driven organisations and political movements around the world. There is a growing number of these organisations that also have chosen to publish their handbooks publicly:
