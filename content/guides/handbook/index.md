So, you have identified something that needs to be added to the handbook? Great! Or maybe a text need to be updated?

The IN handbook is created and maintained in a collaborative effort and access is granted to all members. Access is not just granted, you are also actively encouraged to participate in the process!

**What should you write about?** Only you know. If you have identified something in the workings of the organisation that is unclear/ambiguous, then that probably is a good candidate for an article.

**Do you have an idea for an article but not the capacity and/or knowledge to finish it yourself?** No worries, add it anyway! Hopefully someone else will pick it up and finish it. Remember, team effort.

## Prerequisites

You need a **[GitHub account](https://github.com/join)** to add content to the handbook. If you don't have an account, visit [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and create one.

If you have no idea what GitHub is, please read [this guide first](/guides/github)

When you have created an account, you need to be invited as a member of the IN GitHub organisation. **(LINK)**

## Issues

IN uses the GitHub concept of [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to keep track of new articles and content ideas.

**What is an issue anyway?**

From [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/):

> Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email - except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team.

For the context of the handbook, you could view issues as post-its on a whiteboard during a co-creation session, or as shared documents with a memory and a direction.

- One issue represents one page in the handbook - one topic
- Issues are added to a virtual whiteboard called the [Handbook editorial process](https://github.com/initiativets/handbook/projects)

Now, move on and [create som content!](/guides/handbook/add-edit)
